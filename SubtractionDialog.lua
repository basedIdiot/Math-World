    '[Subtraction]: It’s okay if you haven’t! Addition and I are family! I am the opposite of Addition. Addition is when you take multiple numbers and add them together. Subtraction is when you take away!',
    '[Subtraction]: “-” is the symbol for subtraction. You say it like “minus.”',
    '[Subtraction]: Let’s say I have OOOOOOOOO! If I take away OOOO, how many O do I have left?',
    '[Subtraction]: Help me count! OOOOOOOOO - OOOO = OOOOO. How much is that in numbers? We start with 9 stars, and we take away, or minus 4 stars.',
    '[Subtraction]: Let’s count!',
    '[Subtraction]: Did you get 5?',
    '[Subtraction]: That’s correct!',
    '[Subtraction]: How about another practice problem?',
    '[Subtraction]: I have 5 circles. If I lose two circles, how many circles do I have left?',
    '[Subtraction]: First we can set up our numbers! 5-3. What is 5-3?',
    '[Subtraction]: 5-3 is two!',
    '[Subtraction]: Let’s count it.',
    '[Subtraction]: I have OOOOO. I lose OO. How much O do I have left?',
    '[Subtraction]: OOOOO - OO = OOO.',
    '[Subtraction]: And we get 3! That is called a difference. In addition, we call the total number we get a sum, and in subtraction, our total number is called a “difference.”',
    '[Subtraction]: Got that?',
    '[You]: But what if I have to subtract 5 from 3. That would mean OOO - OOOOO, but there aren\'t enough Os to remove.',
    '[Subtraction]: Hmmm. You must become stronger to comprehend such a thing. You must find Multiplication for guidance.',
    '[Subtraction]: Here\'s a good problem.',
